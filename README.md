## Darkmatter Family

The dark matter family encompasses various hypothetical particle candidates that could explain the gravitational effects observed in the universe that cannot be accounted for by visible matter alone. These candidates span a wide range of masses and interaction strengths.

### Primary Dark Matter Candidates

#### 1. **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)**
- Mass range: 10 GeV to several TeV
- Interact via weak nuclear force and gravity
- Most studied candidates include neutralinos from supersymmetry
- Detection methods: Direct detection experiments (XENON, LUX, PANDAX)

#### 2. **Axions**
- Mass range: 10^-6 to 10^-2 eV
- Proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics
- Extremely light and weakly interacting
- Detection methods: ADMX, CAST, IAXO experiments

#### 3. **Sterile Neutrinos**
- Mass range: keV to GeV scale
- Right-handed neutrinos that don't interact via weak force
- Could explain neutrino oscillations
- Detection methods: X-ray observations, neutrino experiments

#### 4. **Primordial Black Holes**
- Mass range: varies widely (10^-8 to 10^5 solar masses)
- Formed in the early universe
- Gravitational interactions only
- Detection methods: Gravitational wave observations, microlensing

#### 5. **Dark Photons**
- Hypothetical massive particles similar to photons
- Mix with ordinary photons (kinetic mixing)
- Mass range: 10^-3 eV to GeV scale
- Detection methods: Beam dump experiments, collider searches

### Properties of Dark Matter

Dark matter is characterized by:
- **Non-luminous**: Does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation
- **Gravitational interaction**: Affects galaxy rotation curves and cluster dynamics
- **Abundance**: Constitutes approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content
- **Stability**: Must be stable or have a lifetime longer than the age of the universe
- **Cold or Warm**: Velocity distribution affects structure formation

### Observational Evidence

1. **Galaxy Rotation Curves**: Orbital velocities remain constant far from galactic centers
2. **Gravitational Lensing**: Bending of light around massive galaxy clusters
3. **Cosmic Microwave Background**: Temperature fluctuations indicate dark matter density
4. **Large Scale Structure**: Distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters
5. **Bullet Cluster**: Separation of visible and dark matter during cluster collision

### Current Research Directions

- Direct detection experiments deep underground
- Indirect detection via gamma rays, cosmic rays, and neutrinos
- Collider searches at the LHC and future accelerators
- Astrophysical observations and N-body simulations
- Alternative theories (MOND, modified gravity)
